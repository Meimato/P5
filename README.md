Added two classes to handle the Cart.
Tried to use an array to store the IDs for every product added to the Cart.
Used LocalStorage to set and get the product.

BUG
It only works for one kind of product. Every time I add another item, the array will be reset and so the cart.

*** UPDATE ***
Remove the Product class and converted the cart class into an Object.
I also tried using a Constructor and the Prototype, and I still get the same bug.
